# TestQuest EDUCHAIN Code Notes

### "Our Quest is to elevate the Online Learning (and eventually Teaching) experience with Gamification, AI, and Open Campus Blockchain ($EDU)"

TestQuest is a hackathon project by two ex-teachers and educational web developers:
- Donzo The Wizard ([Github](https://github.com/Donzo), [Devpost](https://devpost.com/mortonteaches)) 
- Tippi The Wingbird ([Github](https://github.com/tippi-fifestarr), [Devpost](https://devpost.com/tippi-fifestarr)).

**Smart Contracts**:
Located in the code/smart-contracts/ folder, our smart contracts function number one is security and ownership. Think of it like a public leaderboard, decentralized database of tests, credential verifier, automatic reward vending machine.

See [code/sol/readme.md](./sol/readme.md) for more details

**Backend**:
A secure and secret thing.

**Frontend UI**:
Elevating the Learner with new experiences!

**SQL Database**
A simple, private database for things we don't want on a public ledger.

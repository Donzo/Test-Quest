# TestQuest Smart Contract Walkthrough

Our frontend and smart contracts elevate Learners and Teachers with AI-powered tests with games and blockchain-enabled digital assets as rewards.

## Smart Contract, Authenticate!

In our top-secret backend, Donzo's wallet is authorized to register new users. Initally, we can let them complete a certain number of tests/quests before "Allowing" them to interact with our smart contract, and automatically mint them some $GOLD.

Authorized Address: 0x00f8306c110058b12c00b478986bc3627346671c

## Allowed Users, Earn More $GOLD with $EDU

For an updatable amount of $EDU, users can increase their GOLD Boost level.

*Gold Boost Tiers*:
- Tier 0: Default.  1x GOLD
- Tier 1: 1 $EDU : 2x GOLD EARNED
- Tier 2: 10 $EDU : 3x GOLD EARNED
- Tier 3: 100 $EDU : 5x GOLD EARNED

## Smart Contract, Equip!

Once they have enough $GOLD, our contract will allow them to buy an equipment set NFT:

- Sword & Shield: + Attack, + Defence
- Wizard's Hat: + Magic, + Range
- Spear: ++ Attack
- Bow & Arrow: + Atack, + Range

If they have this item, our frontend will let them Equip it in-game to recieve bonuses.
Each equipment set is unique, beginning with one random name and one random trait ("cute", "scary", "ancient", "cool")

## Equipment Bonus, Upgrade

For $GOLD, players can increase the quality of their NFT's stats.

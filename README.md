TestQuest is a hackathon project by two ex-teachers and educational web developers:

- Tippi The Wingbird ([Github](https://github.com/tippi-fifestarr), [Devpost](https://devpost.com/tippi-fifestarr)).

Our goal is to elevate the Learner and Teacher experience with cutting edge AI and blockchain technology. **Set your grade level, pick your topic, learn and then play!"**

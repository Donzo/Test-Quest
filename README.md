TestQuest is a hackathon project by two educational web developers who were once teachers:

- Donzo The Wizard ([Github](https://github.com/Donzo), [Devpost](https://devpost.com/mortonteaches)) 
- Tippi The Wingbird ([Github](https://github.com/tippi-fifestarr), [Devpost](https://devpost.com/tippi-fifestarr))

Our goal is to elevate the Learner and Teacher experience with cutting edge AI and blockchain technology. **Set your grade level, pick your topic, learn and then play!"**

**Most of the relevant code for judges and interested developers lives in the [`/code` folder](./code).**

Tippi has embedded readme.md files throughout the codebase along with some easter eggs.
